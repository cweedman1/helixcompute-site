# Helix Compute — Selective Compute Engine

Stop recomputing everything.

Helix Compute processes only what changed — reducing compute cost, minimizing data transfer, and preserving exact, verifiable state reconstruction.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

Traditional pipelines:
- Recompute entire datasets
- Transfer full state
- Waste compute on unchanged data

Helix Compute:
- Computes only deltas
- Applies selective updates
- Reconstructs full state deterministically

---

## ⚡ Key Properties

- **~95% compute reduction** on sparse updates  
- **98–99.9% data reduction** depending on dataset  
- **Bitwise exact reconstruction (SHA-256 verified)**  
- Works with:
  - JSON datasets
  - NDJSON / streaming logs
  - Telemetry pipelines

## 🧪 Example Run

```bash
cd examples
python run.py

🧠 What This Means

Systems with sparse changes benefit massively

Streaming / telemetry pipelines see extreme reductions

Reconstruction is exact, not approximate


Helix Compute does not optimize compute.

It avoids unnecessary compute entirely.

🔬 How It Works (High-Level)

1. Load base dataset


2. Apply small mutation (simulated change)


3. Compute delta (insert/update/delete)


4. Apply selective compute (only changed records)


5. Rebuild full dataset


6. Verify with SHA-256




---

🔐 Validation

All outputs are verified via:

SHA-256(original) == SHA-256(rebuilt)

No approximation. No drift.


---

🧭 Status

Prototype / proof-of-concept.

Validated across:

structured datasets

log streams (NDJSON)

multi-scale record counts
